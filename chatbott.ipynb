This increased pressure can damage blood vessels and organs, leading to serious health problems.\n\nHeadache is a common symptom of hypertension, especially in the morning or after exercise. Other symptoms may include:\n\n- Dizziness\n- Fatigue\n- Nausea\n- Shortness of breath\n- Chest pain\n\n**Recommended Next Steps:**\n\n- **See your doctor:*- If you have a headache and other symptoms of hypertension, it's important to see your doctor for evaluation. Your doctor will measure your blood pressure and perform other tests to confirm the diagnosis.\n- **Monitor your blood pressure:*- Once you're diagnosed with hypertension, it's crucial to monitor your blood pressure regularly. You can do this at home with a blood pressure monitor.\n- **Make lifestyle changes:*- Some lifestyle changes can help lower blood pressure, such as:\n    - Losing weight\n    - Eating a healthy diet low in sodium\n    - Exercising regularly\n    - Quitting smoking\n    - Reducing alcohol intake\n- **Take medication:*- If lifestyle changes aren't enough to lower your blood pressure, your doctor may prescribe medication. There are different types of blood pressure medications available, and your doctor will recommend the best option for you.\n\n**Cure:**\n\nThere is no cure for hypertension, but it can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. By following your doctor's recommendations, you can reduce your blood pressure and lower your risk of developing serious health problems."

A deficiency can lead to loss of taste.\n- **Smoking:*- Smoking can damage the taste buds.\n- **Radiation therapy:*- Radiation treatment for head and neck cancer can damage the taste buds.\n- **Age:*- As we get older, the number of taste buds decreases, leading to a gradual decline in taste sensitivity.\n\n**Guidance:**\n\n- **See a doctor if the loss of taste is sudden or severe.*- This could indicate an underlying medical condition that requires treatment.\n- **If the loss of taste is mild, it may resolve on its own.*- Try the following tips to help improve it:\n    - **Rinse your mouth with salt water.*- This can help clear out any congestion in the sinuses.\n    - **Suck on zinc lozenges.*- Zinc is essential for taste function.\n    - **Eat foods with strong flavors.*- This can help stimulate the taste buds.\n    - **Avoid smoking.**\n    - **Get enough sleep.*- Fatigue can worsen loss of taste.\n- **If the loss of taste persists or worsens, you may need to see a specialist.*- An ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor or a neurologist can help determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment."
